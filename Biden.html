<p style="margin-top:45px;">A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, Mr. Trump followed in his father’s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City. There, the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and, subsequently, throughout the world.

Mr. Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers.  His first book, The Art of the Deal, is considered a business classic.</p>
